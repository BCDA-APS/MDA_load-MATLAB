These utilities are used for accessing MDA files generated by the
saveData routine in EPICS, and can handles MDA files of any dimension.
The MDA file versions handled with this code are 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4.

The mdaload.m code is described in the mdaload_m.pdf documentation,
showing how to use the code and the resulting data structures.  In the
"example" directory is sample MATLAB code for loading a sample MDA
data file.

To install the code, simply put it where MATLAB or Octave expect to
file the ".m" files.
